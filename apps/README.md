# Awesome Homelab

This page in the homelab repoistory is a way to feature all of the apps that I have running! While the purpose of the directory is to give a home of all the apps that don't need their own guides and resources, it will still feature everything I run on my machines. Formatting of the readme inspired by [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted).

**This is a work in progress.**

## Automation
* MeTube - Web GUI for youtube-dl, with playlist support, quaility options, and direct downloads. Using this on my Unriad machine, with my projects folder exposed, as the main use case is gathering clips for content creation. [[official repo]](https://github.com/alexta69/metube)

## Dashboards

Dashboards give a graphic user interface to organize, monitorm and view your services or dash.

* [Homearr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6vcTIzp_Ww) - Sleek, modern dashboard with many integrations and web-based config. Using this as my browser homepage giving a nice overview of everything I need. Currently, I have this setup using on my Servarr Proxmox container using their [compose configuration](https://homarr.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#-docker-compose) in it's own stack, setting the directory to ```/docker/homearr/data:/data```, etc. [[official website]](https://homarr.dev/) [[nzbget fix]](https://github.com/ajnart/homarr/issues/559#issuecomment-1377959472)
