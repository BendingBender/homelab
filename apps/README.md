# Awesome Homelab

This page in the homelab repoistory is a way to feature all of the apps that I have running! While the purpose of the directory is to give a home of all the apps that don't need their own guides and resources, it will still feature everything I run on my machines. Formatting of the readme inspired by [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted).

**This is a work in progress.**

## Dashboards

Dashboards give a graphic user interface to organize, monitorm and view your services or dash.

Using this as my browser homepage giving a nice overview of everything I need. Currently, I have this setup using on my Servarr Proxmox container using their [compose configuration](https://homarr.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#-docker-compose) in it's own stack, setting the directory to ```/docker/homearr/data:/data```, etc. [[official website]](https://homarr.dev/)
