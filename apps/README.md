# Awesome Homelab

This page in the homelab repoistory is a way to feature all of the apps that I have running! While the purpose of the directory is to give a home of all the apps that don't need their own guides and resources, it will still feature everything I run on my machines. Formatting of the readme inspired by [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted).
